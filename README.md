# reactjsproject
Sample React JS project using Material UI
Assuming you have node.js installed, please extract the files into any of the existing folder that contains the node_modules folder.

I only added the following modules as i felt those are the only one's required for this demo project.
React, React-DOM, Material-UI, webpack, webpack-dev-server, babel kit.fetch to call APIs.
